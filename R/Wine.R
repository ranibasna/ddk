#' For the purpose of testing the efficiency of DDK methods we choose the classical functional wine spectra dataset. The wine dataset is provided by
#' Professor Marc Meurens of the University Catholique de Louvain.
#'
#' The data set consists of results collected from an experiment measuring the alcohol concentration in wine samples by mid infrared spectroscopy.
#' The training and validation sets contain 94 and 30 spectra, respectively
