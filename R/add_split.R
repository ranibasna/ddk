#' @title adding an optimal splitting point by choosing it from a set of potential splits.
#'
#' @description for a given data \code{f}, and a set of intervals (that have end points given in 'LE' and 'RE'),
#'  left and right hand side endpoints,
#' all in the range [1:nx], this function finds the an additional split (knot) from the set of potential knots \code{splits}
#'  by minimizing the average mean square error of piecewise constant approximation to (rowwise) functional data given in f
#' that result from adding a new split. The intervals do not need to cover the entire range of f.
#' We use convention that for LE[k], the k-th interval is '(LE[k]+1):RE[k]'
#' which corresponds to open-closed intervals in the 'continuous' interpretation of the intervals (LE[k],RE[k]]
#' The minimization is over all k. The noimnated optimal splits within each interval are already given in the input and
#' the algorithm returns new optimal within interval splits that are increased by one and only modified in
#' the two intervals
#'
#'
#' @param f  n x nx matrix, where n is number of samples (rows) and nx reperesents the grid size in functional data interpreptation.
#' @param M the minimal number of points per intervals between knots for further split of the optimization to be performed.
#'          The default is 5. It means that if there is less than M points per interval the further split of the interval
#'          marked by knots is not performed. The program will stop if there is too few points to find the requested number
#'          of knots with the given restriction for M.
#' @param LE vector of integers. indices for the left endpoints that are given as vectors of K integers in the range from 0 to nx-1,
#' @param RE vector of integers. indices for the right endpoints that are given as vectors of K integers in the range from 1 to nx,
# They are ordered and moreover: LE[k]<RE[k]<=LE[k+1]<RE[k+1], k in 1:K (do not need to cover the whole range of f)
#' @param AMSE vector of K values of the average mean square errors of the piecewise constant approximation based on given knots
#' @param AMSE1 vector of K values of the left-hand side (with respect to corresponding 'splits' below) values of the average mean square error
#' @param AMSE2 vector of K values of the righ-hand side (with respect to corresponding 'splits' below) values of the average mean square error
#' @param splits vector of K values of the suggested splits (they are chosen optimally within given interval and
#' will be used to choose a new knot). The knot is chosen according to the criterium: the split leading to the largest gain accross all between knots intervals becomes a new knot.
#'
#' @return the list of the following:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{NLE} and \item{NRE} -- two vectors of all K+1 ordered indices within the range [1:nx]representing end points of new increased by one set of intervals obtained
#' by adding the optimal knot (the optimal split of one of the input intervals)
#' \item{nsplits}-{a vector of K+1 values of the suggested splits (for using in the next iteration of this functiom to choose a new knot). These splits are optimal within intervals.}
#' \item{NAMSE}-{the K+1 vector of new the average mean square errors over the intervals obtained from the knots including the new one.}
#' \item{NAMSE1}-{the vector of K+1 values of the left-hand side (with respect to corresponding 'splits') values of the average mean square errors}
#' \item{NAMSE2}-{a vector of K+1 values of the right-hand side (with respect to corresponding 'splits') values of the average mean square errors}
#' \item{locsp}-{the location (left hand side) of the added new optimal split location,i.e. the split occurs in (LE[k]+1):RE[k], where k=locsp while LE and RE are the input values,
#' in the terms of output the new split is at NLE[k+1]=NRE[k]}
